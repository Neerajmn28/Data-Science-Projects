## 📝 Projects Overview
1. Covid-19 Classification 🦠
Description: A machine learning project where I built a classification model to predict COVID-19 cases based on various health and demographic features. This project helps in identifying potential cases based on the available data.
* Techniques Used: Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Data preprocessing, Model evaluation 🔍
* Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas


3. Project2: NLP (Natural Language Processing) 🗣️
Description: This project dives into NLP techniques for processing and analyzing text data. From text classification to sentiment analysis, I implemented multiple algorithms to analyze and extract insights from text data like reviews, articles, and more! 📰
* Techniques Used: Text preprocessing, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms 💬
* Tools Used: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas


5. Project3: Digit Recognizer ✍️
Description: A deep learning project to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Using neural networks, I developed a model that can predict digits from images. 🧠💡
* Techniques Used: Image classification, Neural Networks, Deep Learning (CNNs) 🖼️
* Tools Used: Python, Keras, TensorFlow

6. Spotify API Music Recommendation 🎶
Description: Built a personalized music recommendation system using the Spotify API. By analyzing user preferences and track features, the system suggests songs based on listening history, genres, and moods. 🎧
* Techniques Used: Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering, Recommender Systems 🎵
* Tools Used: Python, Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper), Pandas

7. Time Series Forecasting 📊
Description: This project focuses on predicting future trends based on historical data. Whether it’s sales, stock prices, or weather patterns, I used ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast time series data. 🔮
* Techniques Used: Time series analysis, ARIMA, SARIMA, Forecasting 📈
* Tools Used: Python, Statsmodels, Pandas
